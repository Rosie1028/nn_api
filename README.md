National News Summarizer is a full-stack application developed as my final thesis project during my Bachelor's degree.
The project explores the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate concise summaries from long-form news articles. It integrates a custom pipeline based on the NASES architecture and provides a user-friendly interface for real-time summarization. To support this system, I scraped and compiled a dataset of Cuban news articles and their corresponding summaries, which I published on Kaggle: Cuban News Dataset. Although I did not complete fine-tuning the model, I used this dataset to evaluate the quality of generated summaries by comparing them with human-written ones.
